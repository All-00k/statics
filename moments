explaination: (moments describe how something is distributed relative to a center)






# In statistics, a moment is a measure related to the shape of a distribution. Moments help describe the location, spread, skewness, and kurtosis of a data set.

 # MOMENTS ABOUT ORIGIN
  ----------------------
------------->First moment about origin (mean): Tells the central value of the data.

------------->Second moment about mean(variance): Tells the spread or dispersion from the mean.

------------->Third moment about mean(skewness): Tells the asymmetry of the data.

------------->Fourth moment about mean(kurtosis): Tells the "tailedness" (how heavy or light the tails are) or we can say kurotsis tells the degree of flatness.


# moments are calculated with respect to:
1.moment about mean (𝜇 r)
2.moment about origin (v r)
3.moment about arbitary point (𝜇' r)
